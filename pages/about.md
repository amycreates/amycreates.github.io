Hello, my names Amy Gordon. I'm currently studying at Oxford Brookes University and have made this website as part of a project to present travel blog posts and recipes. The site was primarily created to provide insight into Mexican Street Food recipes and to also give further knowledge into learning about places around the world from reading into the blog posts.

Having personally been to the locations of the blog posts, it will allow you to feel as if you are having good advice from someone who has physically been there and experienced it themselves.

Enjoy!
