# Quesadillas

In its most basic form, a quesadilla is simply a grilled tortilla with melted cheese inside. You can add additional fillings if you’d like.

## Ingredients

Per quesadilla

- 1 whole-grain flour tortilla (about 8″ diameter)
- ½ cup freshly grated cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup cooked black beans or pinto beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 tablespoon chopped red bell pepper or jarred roasted bell pepper or a few thinly sliced cherry tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon chopped red onion or green onion
- 1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapeño (if you like heat)
- 1 teaspoon avocado oil, melted butter or extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing
- Any of the following, for serving: Salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole or strips of avocado, sour cream, hot sauce, chopped fresh cilantro

## Method

1. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Warm your tortilla for about 30 seconds, flipping halfway. Flip once more, then sprinkle one-half of the tortilla with about half of the cheese.
2. Cover the cheese evenly with the remaining fillings: beans, bell pepper, onion and jalapeño (if using).
3. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the fillings, and fold over the empty side of the tortilla to enclose the fillings.
4. Quickly brush the top of the quesadilla with a light coating of oil, then carefully flip it with a spatula.
5. Let the quesadilla cook until golden and crispy on the bottom, about 1 to 2 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent burning the tortilla.
6. Brush the top with a light coating of oil, then flip it and cook until the second side is golden and crispy.
7. Immediately remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board.
8. Let it cool for a minute to give the cheese time to set, then use a chef’s knife to slice it into 3 pieces.
9. Serve promptly, with any sauces or garnishes that you’d like.
