# Tamales

Tamales are a traditional dish in dozens of countries around Central and South America. Mexican tamales feature a corn-based masa (dough) wrapped around a filling and steamed in a corn husk. They are traditionally filled with either chicken, pork, beef, cheese and/or beans. You can fill them with just about anything youâ€™d like.

## Ingredients

- Masa
- 1 lb. shredded cheese
- 4 cups tamale masa - tortilla mix will not work
- 1/2 bunch cilantro leaves
- 4-6 chopped scallions
- 1/2 tbs. cumin powder
- 1 tbs. garlic powder
- Minced jalapenos (optional)
- 2 tsp. salt
- Ground pepper
- Other seasonings, such as Goya Sazon, taco seasoning, chili powder, etc.
- 3 1/2 cups chicken broth or water
- 1 1/4 cups lard or Crisco

## Method

1. Corn husks come in different sizes, so take the largest ones and tear them in strips for tying rolled tamales. You will get very few ideal size husks in the package, so be creative
2. Soak about a third of a bag of husks in warm water for 15 minutes.
3. Prepare your filling (s)
4. Pour masa mix into a bowl, mix with broth/water
5. Cut lard into small chunks, add to a bowl, stir it in
6. Add other ingredients and mix well
7. If mixture is too wet, and doesn't stick fairly well to the husks when you spread it, add a bit more masa to the bowl
8. Take a husk and spread 3-4 tbs. of dough in it and spread to the top and sides, or just in the middle, depending on the shape you want
9. Top the dough with the filling
10. Using both hands, roll the masa edges together with the husk from the sides and the top and bottom. Use your fingers ensuring that filling is covered top, bottom, and in the middle seam
11. Use a second husk, if necessary
12. Tie up the tamale in the desired shape. Use scissors to trim ties and husks.
13. When finished with all of them, put enough water in your cooker to almost touch the holes in the bottom of the pot
14. Place the tamales in the pot, keeping the ones with open tops standing up.
15. Stack them so steam can readily move throughout the pot
16. Bring the water to a boil, cover the pot, turn down heat to medium low (simmer) and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Midway through, pour a cup of water down the inside of the pot, so there is enough water to keep the bottom from burning
17. Tamales are done when you unroll one and it is firm, and readily pulls away from the husk
18. If you have leftover husks when first making them, air dry them and put them back in the package, or just freeze them.
19. Serve with salsa, enchilada sauce, or red chile gravy
20. Tamales freeze well for weeks, and make wonderful pot luck and holiday items
