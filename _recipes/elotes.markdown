# Mexican Elotes

This is a classic way to eat corn in Mexico, and is usually bought from street vendors. Mexican crema is used on the corn as it is similar to soured cream, but saltier and creamier â€“ perfect for cooling the fiery chili powder in this recipe!

## Ingredients

- butter 50g
- garlic 1 clove, crushed
- cayenne pepper
- corn on the cob 6, husks removed
- cotija or feta 50g, crumbled
- coriander a small bunch, chopped
- lime wedges to serve
- soured cream 100g
- double cream 50g

## Method
1. To make the crema, mix the soured cream and double cream with 1/4 tsp salt. Cover, and leave at room temperature for 3 hours. Keep out if using straight away, or chill and keep for up to 3 days.
2. Light the barbecue, and wait until the coals are grey and the flames have died down. Meanwhile heat the butter with the garlic and a pinch of cayenne in a small pan until melted, and season. Char the cobs for 10-15 minutes, continually turning, until the kernels are tender and lightly charred all over
3. Brush the cobs with the melted butter, then spread the crema over evenly. Crumble over the cotija and sprinkle with a good pinch of cayenne pepper.
