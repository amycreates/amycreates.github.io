## Method

1. Cook the chicken, slice, dice and shred the garnishes and have all this ready to use. **Tip*** the avocado will start to brown so you can either do this right before you serve it or rub with a little lemon to prevent the browning.
2. Next is making the sauce, slice the onion and garlic and put onto a pan to fry for a while, add a small amount of oil to prevent it from burning.
3. After about 5 minutes, you can remove them and set aside.
4. In a pot, add a couple of cups of water and bring to the boil. Add the peppers and leave them for about 10 minutes until they are soft. Drain and add them to a blender, add the onion, garlic, tomato, salt, pepper and cumin and blend until you have a smooth sauce.
5. Next, add the vegetable oil to a frying pan on a medium low heat. In a pot or deep pan, add the enchilada sauce and keep on a low heat. You also need tongs, a plate with paper towels and a spare plate or cutting board to roll and prepare the enchiladas.
6. First take one tortilla, dip into the oil and cook on each side for 2 minutes each.
7. Next dry off some of the extra oil, then dip and cover completely on both sides with the sauce. Tip* Don't worry if you feel there isn't enough sauce on the tortilla you can add more at the end.
8. Next add the stuffing, the chicken and place in the centre of the tortilla.
9. Set aside until all the batch is used.
10. Once you have finished rolling the enchiladas, you can add more sauce on top, then start topping with the garnishes.
