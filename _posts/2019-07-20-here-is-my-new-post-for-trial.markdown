A city as beautiful as Paris, is one that has been drawing tourists for years. From its incredible known monuments and tasty cuisine it is a must visit! However, visiting in peak times may prove more difficult getting into the popular attractions for example, the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.

**Eiffel Tower**
The Eiffel Tower never ceases to impress with fantastic 360 degree views across the whole of Paris. It is also one of the most visited pay-to-enter monuments in the world, with almost 7 million visitors every year. As the queues can be long during certain periods, it may be useful to book ahead and skip the queues- _I didn’t book in advance as we were unsure what day at the time we were going to go but, stood outside in January for quite some time was pretty freezing!_ The ticket prices depend on whether you walk or get the lift and what level you go up to- _I personally chose to get the lift ticket to the top floor as you can’t get the stairs to the top of the tower._ On the lower level, there are walls covered in historical information on the tower, a gift shop and restaurant, which is an interesting added feature to just getting good photos! On a side note, every evening the tower is illuminated with golden sparkles for 5 minutes upon the hour, which is a must see during your time visiting Paris!

**Louvre Museum**
The Louvre, which dates back to the 1200s, is now home to artwork dating back to many years ago. The art collections are divided into five levels with three interconnecting wings- _I unfortunately didn’t go inside the museum purely due to the HUGE queue to get into the building. The museum from the outside is abstract and a different shape compared to most and hope I may see the inside in potential future visits!_
