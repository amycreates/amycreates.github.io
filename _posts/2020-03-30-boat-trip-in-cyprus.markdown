Cyprus is the third largest Mediteranean island, located south of Turkey. Its cuisines are influenced by the Middle East, commonly using herbs, spices and olive oil as their main components to their dishes. Having travelled there back in 2014 myself, I have a few good memories of the place but I would definitely like to go back to explore more of Paphos in future.

## Paphos
With Paphos being the main area to go when visiting Cyprus, it brings many excursions and exciting things to see with it.  Aphroditeâ€™s Rock is somewhere I wish I had seen. Some people may just think of it simple as a 'rock' but it is one of the most famous mythological spots in the world. There is apparently a myth that if you swim around the rock 3 times around the rocks it brings beauty and youth to you, however it is advised not to do this due to the rocky seas.

Secondly, another place to see during your visit may be to see a private/blue lagoon. It is warmer than the rest of the area and has crystal blue waters in the bay. You can simply swim in the waters but you can also go snorkelling to see plenty of fish and rocks below.

Thirdly, going for a food tour to enjoy the best foods and wines of Cyprus. On these food tours, you are able to enjoy unique flavours and knowledge you may not have received if you went out to restaurants yourself.  

## Boat Trip

As we didn't hire a car in Cyprus (which I think people should if you do come to Cyprus due to many hotels being in the middle of nowhere like mine), we used the hotel taxi and minibus service to get to surrounding areas. We got taken to the nearest harbour as my family and I all wanted to go on a boat trip. This appeared more difficult than we thought, due to my mum having broken a bone in her toe before we went on holiday and needed to wear a boot with crutches across the duration of our trip.

The boat ride itself was lovely and we were taken to many stop off points to have a swim. However, the best part about the boat trip was that they offered parasailing as an added extra to your trip. I'd definitely recommend this if it is on your bucket list as it offers many beautiful views across the sea and island which you would never see on land.
