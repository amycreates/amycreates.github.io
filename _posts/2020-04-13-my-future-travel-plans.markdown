Exploring a new place each week throughout the blogs has made me realise how lucky I have been to travel to all these places in my life. My parents took me abroad from when I was in year 4 or 5 and I thank them for that. As I'm only 21, it just makes me more excited to travel to more places in the future and explore more of this big wide world.

**Future Plans**

So, fingers crossed this pandemic ends by the second half of the year as I am scheduled to go to New York at the end of September. I think New York is either on your bucket list of places to go or not as I know some people aren't fazed by 'The City That Never Sleeps', but for me it's definitely one of my top dream places to go to (I even have a canvas in my room of the skyline to remind me, which my parents brought me years ago!). I know some of my friends' holiday plans have already been cancelled for the summer months, just really hoping it doesn't carry on to the rest of the year!

For my final blog post I thought I would discuss the plans for New York on where I'd like to visit:

**Walk round Central Park:** Just going to take in the surroundings and maybe even rent a bike to get to see more of it!

**Visit the Empire State Building:** I think it would be pretty cool to go up and look across the whole of New York but I'm thinking about maybe going to a nearby rooftop bar to get the view of the Empire State Building.

**See the Statue of Liberty:** Not much to say apart from getting lots of pictures.

**Watch a Broadway show:** So I've been told by many people this is something I have to do in New York, however it may be quite expensive and also depends on what show is on in September time.

**Walk along Brooklyn Bridge:** Again, this may be a good one to get a good view across New York plus it's free to cross so that sounds good to me!

**Walk along the High Line:** So I wasn't aware of this place before searching about it and it's basically an old train line that has been transformed into a park! I think it would be a pretty cool place to see the visionary park design.

After New York, I am also considering going interrailing around to a few places in Europe to see more in a shorter amount of time. I think watching Escape Across The World has got me more excited to travel more just like they did!
