Like most places in Mexico, youâ€™d expect beauty. A hidden gem in Mexico is a small island named _Isla Mujeres_. It was first considered a secret to tourists but is now commonly visited yearly now.

Just off the coast of Cancun a short ferry ride away, you reach white sandy beaches and fewer people from the popular hotel zone back in Cancun. The preferred mode of transport to travel round the island is by scooters or golf carts- I rented a golf cart for a certain period of time at fixed rates from the where the ferry departs from Cancun pier and you are provided with a map on where to find your golf cart provider. The most popular beach destination on the island is Playa Norte where you can hire umbrellas and chairs at a small price- _as you can expect the sea is much warmer than the English sea!_ The best part about the island is not entirely the beautiful beaches, it's the freedom to explore the small island. Hiring the golf cart is such a fun and different way of travelling around it is a must when visiting. Across the island there is snorkelling, glass boats and divings tours at various points around the beaches.

On the island's west coast you'll find _Tortugranja_, the island's turtle sanctuary and rehabilitation centre. Although the place is small, with a small entry fee too, it is a great spot to visit during the time on the island. There are large open and closed tanks full of sea creatures and turtles freely swimming around, including the huge outside sea space for more turtles to live in- _the tour provider at the hotel tried to persuade me not to visit the rehabilitation centre due to it perhaps being seen as upsetting but they are looked after and have a wide space for them to roam._
