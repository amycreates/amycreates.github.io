Gran Canaria is the third largest of the Canary islands. From the more touristy areas of Las Palmas in the North of Gran Canaria to Puerto Rico (which is where I think we stayed?) the island as a whole has much to offer and appears a big attractor for families especially. Like many of Canary islands, it is a paradise for beach lovers. I’d been to Tenerife in previous years, which turned out to be one of my favourite places. Although Gran Canaria was very nice, I think Tenerife still may have beaten it.

## Puerto de Mogan
Considering I was on holiday in Gran Canaria for 10 days visiting the little area of Puerto de Mogan was one of my favourite places and highlight of the trip. It's in the south coast of the island near to where we were staying. To get there, most people arrive by boat which you can get at various points along the coast of Gran Canaria. This picturesque area of Gran Canaria is built around a marina and fishing harbour. It is packed with lots of restaurants serving local fish that arrived from their own fishing harbour and other Canarian and international specialities. It has several banks, supermarkets and shops so you have everything you need within a short walking distance.

Apart from walking around admiring the area, you can also do something a bit more physical such as jet skiing, scuba diving lessons and even booking boating trips from local stalls. The houses all varied creating an individual style to them as you walk round the maze of cobbled streets with overhanging flowers and archways. Apparently, Puerto de Mogan is known as the “Little Venice” which I think is a perfect way to describe this area of Gran Canaria. The streets, pretty views and buildings are similar to what I would describe Venice as.

As our time in Puerto de Mogan was short, we were only able to stay near to the harbour so didn’t fully experience the area as if we were staying overnight however, there’s only so much you can see I guess. After researching more into the area for this blog post, I found that they host a Friday open-air market which fills two plazas by the marina, attracting many tourists who arrive from boats at this point. There are stalls selling things from shoes to glass sculptures.
