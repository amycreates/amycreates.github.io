Lanzarote is the most easterly of the Canary Islands and one of the smallest. Having year-round sun is more or less guaranteed in Lanzarote, or the Canaries as a whole to be honest, which makes it a perfect place to visit if you don’t need to go during the school summer holidays.

The Timanfaya National Park is a popular visit for most tourists coming to the island. The park consists of extraordinary volcanic landscapes as far as the eye can see. You can’t freely walk across the black sands unaccompanied, due to the fragile nature of the surrounding rocks. You can book bus tours at many places around the island and at your hotel, which commonly consists of travelling across the bus track with on-board tour guide. stopping off at the visitors centre for souvenirs and watch potatoes being cooked! Furthermore, you also stop to see the camels, which gives you the chance to ride them (an interesting experience!). The camel ride is around 6 euros per person and it's something fun to do that's different. First we had an evil camel that refused to stand up for us, we had to swap due to its stubbornness! If you haven’t ridden a camel before, prepare for a bumpy ride! The seats aren’t particularly comfy so luckily the ride isn’t too long.

## Teguise Market

Teguise is an historic town in Lanzarote. Teguise is a blueprint for famous architect, with beautiful white low-rise buildings and cobbled streets it has much to offer. The best time to visit Teguise is on Sunday, where they have 400 stalls set up selling a range of local products and handcrafts. I’d recommend arriving early as the market is purely open and can get hot under the sun but it also gets a lot busier and queues for food are longer! If you're looking for souvenirs during your time in Lanzarote it is worth waiting to visit the market to get them as there is alot to choose from at great prices too! Another tip, if you're looking for a bargain be prepared to haggle. As soon as they see someone who is not Spanish the prices immediately go up.
